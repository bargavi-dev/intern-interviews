    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="about-me-paragraph">
        I graduated with a Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences degree in Arizona,
        <br/>
        moved on to teach English as a Second Language in South Korea, and soon after
        <br/>
        decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I initially started taking
        <br/>
        free coding courses online and eventually chose to start meeting weekly Free
        <br/>
        Code Camp meetups in Seoul. I soon found a very supportive community who
        <br/>
        insipred me to take the next step and apply to a coding bootcamp! I am excited
        <br/>
        to see where my coding journey will take me!
